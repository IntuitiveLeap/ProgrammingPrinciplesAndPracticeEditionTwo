# Chapter_0 Review

## Q&A

>Review questions are intended to point you to the key ideas explained in a chapter. One way to look at them is as a complement to the exercises: the exercises focus on the practical aspects of programming, whereas the review questions try to help you articulate the ideas and concepts. In that, they resemble good interview questions.

1. What is software?
    - Software is a program(s), running on a system and being used by people.
2. Why is software important?
    - Software is running our lives in many cases. Ensuring sufficient supply of groceries in a given region, for example. Making sure our map application can accurately show our current location and which way to turn next to get to our destination. Software developed the current generation of life-saving drugs and is involved in generating the next generation of these. Software is allowing your vehicle to run at high efficiency and in many cases, to run at all.
3. Where is software important?
    - I do not think there is an area of human life that isn't impacted by the use of software to some degree.00
4. What could go wrong if some software fails? List some examples.
    - Your car could stop functioning. The plane might be late, or arrive elsewhere. Your surgery could be botched. You might be paid extra. You might not be paid! Your work could be lost irretrievably.
5. Where does software play an important role? List some examples.
    - Medicine, Transportation, Fishing, Farming, Manufacture, Design, Logistics, etc...
6. What are some jobs related to software development? List some.
    - Architect, Developer, Doctor, Psychologist, Administration, etc...
7. What’s the difference between computer science and programming?
    - Programming is mostly related to the physical act of creating code to run on computer systems. Computer Science is used to find trusted ways to implement code running on these systems and to present it with best-practices or proofs.
8. Where in the design, construction, and use of a ship is software used?
    - Everywhere.
9. What is a server farm?
    - A collection of server units.
10. What kinds of queries do you ask online? List some.
    - Geographical, informational, code_related, historical, etc...
11. What are some uses of software in science? List some.
    - Analysis of large data sets. Model creation and sampling.
12. What are some uses of software in medicine? List some.
    - Drug testing. Molecular modelling, etc...
13. What are some uses of software in entertainment? List some.
    - Graphical design, graphical effects, image recording, sound recording, sound modelling, etc...
14. What general properties do we expect from good software?
    - Correctness, ease of use, aesthetically pleasing, etc...
15. What does a software developer look like?
    - A human being.
16. What are the stages of software development?
    - Analysis, Design, Programming, Testing
17. Why can software development be difficult? List some reasons.
    - Difficulty understanding the problem completely. Bad workmanship. Unclear communications. Lack of skill/experience.
18. What are some uses of software that make your life easier?
    - Geo-location and map routing. Cellular technology. Coffee-machines with timers.
19. What are some uses of software that make your life more difficult?
    - Poorly designed login pages. Captcha.

## Exercises

1. `Pick an activity you do most days (such as going to class, eating dinner, or watching television). Make a list of ways computers are directly or indirectly involved.`
    - I often attend classes for IT and other programming related skills. These classes are often accessed by me through a web browser on my computer. I also will often use applications on my PC to either complete assignments or read course materials, such as an IDE to produce code, an interpreter or compiler to run and test the code, a pdf reader or ebook reader application to read course notes or suggested readings, video applications to watch and hear lectures and presentations.
    - The web browser on my PC is connecting to a web-server on the other end, which is probably also connected to one or more database servers, which are probably all housed inside a domain with it's own internal devices and servers such as DNS, possibly routed through a proxy server, all of which are probably connected to an NTP server for current time services, etc...

2. `Pick a profession, preferably one that you have some interest in or some knowledge of. Make a list of activities done by people in that profession that involve computers.`
    - 

3. `Swap your list from exercise 2 with a friend who picked a different profession and improve his or her list. When you have both done that, compare your results. Remember: There is no perfect solution to an open-ended exercise; improvements are always possible.`
    - 

4. `From your own experience, describe an activity that would not have been possible without computers.`
    - 

5. `Make a list of programs (software applications) that you have directly used. List only examples where you obviously interact with a program (such as when selecting a new song on an MP3 player) and not cases where there just might happen to be a computer involved (such as turning the steering wheel of your car).`
    - 

6. `Make a list of ten activities that people do that do not involve computers in any way, even indirectly. This may be harder than you think!`
    - 

7. `Identify five tasks for which computers are not used today, but for which you think they will be used at some time in the future. Write a few sentences to elaborate on each one that you choose.`
    - 

8. `Write an explanation (at least 100 words, but fewer than 500) of why you would like to be a computer programmer. If, on the other hand, you are convinced that you would not like to be a programmer, explain that. In either case, present well-thought-out, logical arguments.`
    - 

9.  `Write an explanation (at least 100 words, but fewer than 500) of what role other than programmer you’d like to play in the computer industry (independently of whether “programmer” is your first choice).`
    - 

10. `Do you think computers will ever develop to be conscious, thinking beings, capable of competing with humans? Write a short paragraph (at least 100 words) supporting your position.`
    - 

11. `List some characteristics that most successful programmers share. Then list some characteristics that programmers are popularly assumed to have.`
    - 

12. `Identify at least five kinds of applications for computer programs mentioned in this chapter and pick the one that you find the most interesting and that you would most likely want to participate in someday. Write a short paragraph (at least 100 words) explaining why you chose the one you did.`
    - 

13. `How much memory would it take to store (a) this page of text, (b) this chapter, (c) all of Shakespeare’s work? Assume one byte of memory holds one character and just try to be precise to about 20%.`
    - this page of text is ~10 KB
    - this chapter of text is ~100 KB
    - all of Shakespeare's work might encompass 15 MB of disk

14. `How much memory does your computer have? Main memory? Disk?`
    - The computer I am writing this on has 128 GB of main memory (ram) and about 6 TB of disk storage (some is HDD and some is SSD).

## Postscript

Our civilization runs on software. Software is an area of unsurpassed diversity and opportunities for interesting, socially useful, and profitable work. When you approach software, do it in a principled and serious manner: you want to be part of the solution, not add to the problems.

- //
  - This is a line comment. This symbol and following text on the same line is ignored by the compiler and is intended for human consumption.
- <<
  - Insertion operator. Used to direct data into a receiving object.
- C++
  - A higher level, compiled programming language built on top of the C language and including object-oriented facilities.
- comment
  - A message written into a source code file that is intended for use specifically by humans and not the compiler.
- compiler
  - A program that translates a higher-level, human-readable language into machine readable language. Also provides type and syntax checking.
- compile-time error
  - An error that occurs during the compilation process.
- cout
  - A function made available by including the std_lib_facilities.h file
- executable
  - The final result of successful compilation and linking. This type of file can be run by the machine directly.
- function
  - A reusable piece of code containing a return type, name, parameters and a body.
- header
  - A file that can be used inside another source file by means of the #include directive.
- IDE
  - An Integrated Development Environment. Usually includes a text editor, debugging facilities, formatting assistance, code highlighting, code completion, etc...
- "#include"
  - The "#include" directive. Commands the pre-processor to copy the file and paste it into the source file in the place of the directive.
- library
  - A separate piece of code intended for reuse inside other applications. Often includes task specific classes, functions or utilities.
- linker
  - A program that links object files together, resulting in an executable file if successful.
- main()
  - A mandatory function for every C++ application. Code execution starts in this function.
- object code
  - the result of compiling a single translation unit.
- output
  - Results of a running application directed outwards to the user(s) on screen on a printer, speakers, etc...
- program
  - A generic word that could refer to a running application, the source code needed to build an application, a .exe file, etc... Also, the set of instructions telling a computer "what to do".
- source code
  - Human readable code in a higher-level language such as C++, C or Python.
- statement
  - A statement is a section of C++ code that specifies an action and is not a pre-processor directive. Usually ends with a semi-colon.

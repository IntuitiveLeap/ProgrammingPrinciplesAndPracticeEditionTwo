# Programming Principles and Practice using C++ -> A workthrough

## Summary

Completing all of the examples, questions, quizzes, etc in the book: Programming Principles and Practice using C++, Second Edition, by Bjarne Stroustrup.

The results in this repository will be divided into folders for each chapter of the book and inside these will be results, code and other artifacts of my read-through and completion of the practices, exercises and reviews.

## Environment

I am using Visual Studio Code as my editor of choice for this project. As the source book itself is centered on C++ I am using GCC and GDB, though the book claims that the code examples can be compiled on any standards compliant compiler. MSVC and Clang should both work with few if any modifications.

# Programming Principles and Practice using C++ -> A workthrough

Completing all of the examples, questions, quizzes, etc in the book: Programming Principles and Practice using C++, Second Edition, by Bjarne Stroustrup.

The results in this repository will be divided into folders for each chapter of the book and inside these will be nested sub-folders containing results, code and other artifacts of my read-through and completion of the practices, exercises and reviews, along with any notes that I deem relevant for my own personal learning.
